# PackaTron

Welcome to my LaTeX repository. You can find a few packages I use to write my lecture notes, my presentations and more (based on various sources - I will try to track them down to credit them, but it won't be easy).

## lectron

It is a package that imports for me a lot of useful packages for maths/CS writing. It helps me keep my headers clean for each of my tex files. Besides, there are some custom environment, some beautiful front pages and other useful stuff.

### Options:

- `EN` (English) or `FR` (French) for the language.
- `colorbox` to enable 'colorbox' package and draw beautiful color boxes around environment.

## presentatron

It is quite similar to the previous package, but adapted to Beamer presentation.

### Options:

- `EN` (English) or `FR` (French) for the language.
- `colorbox` to enable 'colorbox' package and draw beautiful color boxes around environment.

## raccourcitron

It is a collection of all my custom commands / operators for LaTeX math writing. Nothing more to say.
